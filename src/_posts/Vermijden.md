Vermijden bij [[ADHD]].

# Uitstel / Vermijden
Vermijden van dingen die heel ingewikkeld *voelen*.

#### De 4 Redenen tegen vermijding:
The 4 reasons why we’re procrastinating:

1. [ ]  We feel like we’re not making progress
2. [ ]  We’re not sure where to start 
	- [[Niet weten wat ik moet doen|Niet weten wat ik moet kiezen]]
	- [[Niet weten waar te moeten beginnen]]
3. [ ]  We’re afraid of failing
	- [[Faalangst]]
4. [ ]  We dislike the task itself
	- Schoonmaken

## Gedachtes
#### Wat zegt de bijbel
> ### _Gebruik uw dagen goed, want we leven in een slechte tijd_
> Efeziërs 5:15
 
Schrander: _van intelligentie getuigend_

You don’t know what tomorrow will bring. By all means plan ahead, but don’t procrastinate. I’m not kidding.

> ### _If you can get it done now, then get it done!_

  


## Rationele tips
#### Verwar tijd niet met je gevoel
[[Anti-vermijding tips ADHD]]


**Will your work assignment _really_ take all week, or does it just feel that way?** Sometimes people with ADHD conflate feelings with time. For example, when something _feels_ really difficult, you imagine that it will take your hours to complete. When, in reality, you can complete the task in thirty minutes. A way to address this is to cultivate time awareness. The next time you have a big task, time yourself to see how long it actually takes you to complete it. If you get into the habit of timing yourself, you’ll likely realize that many tasks don’t take as long as you initially thought. ^[ [[Anti-vermijding tips ADHD]] ]



#### Stel jezelf de volgende vragen:
1.  What objects do I need?
2.  What exactly do I need to do? (Specific and in detail.)
3.  Why do I need to do it? (Again, specific and in detail.)

#### Eye opener
> ### _“Why procrastinate forever on an essay you know you’ll do eventually?”_

> ### _“If your projects tend to succeed, your expectations go up and motivation stays strong.”_

#### Getuigenis over [[Perfectionisme]]
- _“I found this very interesting. If I may share another view. I'm a great starter. I have piles and drawers and baskets full of project parts. I have to - do lists for days. My problem is finishing. I think my problem comes from growing up in a perfect household and not being perfect. Everything I did was judged to be not good enough. First that started a feeling of never wanting to show anyone anything I did for fear of being unworthy. Then that morphed into not finishing anything **because if it wasn't finished, it couldn't be judged**. I would get to just the point of being done then a panic would come over me and I put that thing away._
- _Now, on the other hand, the things that I've been told I can do well, I can plow ahead and do amazing and am so very happy with myself. It's taken decades to be happy with myself and not care what others think. There are still times when I want to do something and the past will creep in and tell me it's not worth it because I'll fail anyway. I have fought hard to break through some of those deep rooted feelings of inadequacy and get things done. I'm always happy when I do accomplish something.”_

  

#### 5 second rule
Mel Robins

#### 10/10/10 rule
What could happen if I complete this task?

What could happen if I don’t complete this task?

-   How will I feel about not doing it 10 minutes from now?
-   How about 10 months from now?
-   How about 10 years from now?

What is my overarching vision? Why does it matter?
