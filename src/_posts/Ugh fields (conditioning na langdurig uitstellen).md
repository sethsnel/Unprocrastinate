# Ugh Fields (pavlov)
Waar ik vanaf wil
1. ![[Overwhelm van taken#^13ade0]]
2. Allergisch voor het woord `plannen` / `planning`

## Hoe dit werkt
Langlopende vooruitschuivers werken als volgt:

> _if a person receives **constant negative conditioning via unhappy thoughts** whenever their mind goes into a certain zone of thought, they will begin to develop a psychological flinch mechanism around the thought. The "Unhappy Thing" — the source of negative thoughts — is typically some part of your model of the world that relates to bad things being likely to happen to you._

> _We're not really afraid of events, but of experiencing the emotions associated with them. ("I'm only ever afraid of a feeling, never a task," is how the blogger David Cain applies this to procrastination at [raptitude.com](http://raptitude.com/) – see [is.gd/t3cRPZ.)](http://is.gd/t3cRPZ.))_

## Solution
1.  Actively look out for the **flinch**, preferably when you are in a motivationally "high" state. Better still, do this when you are both motivationally high, not under time pressure, and when you are undertaking an overview of your life. This overview exercise will tend to make your mind range over all of the relevant parts of your life, and hopefully "throw up" some "Ugh!" reactions.
2.  Concretely **visualize how your life could be much better** if you oust control of it from your lizarrd brain. Imagine, in [near-mode](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Near/far_thinking), how much better your future life could be if you can find and "pick off" your Ugh Fields and optimize the relevant part of your life. If you haven't yet identified these areas of your life, imagine that some concrete good thing (such as eating ice-cream, laughing with friends, etc) will happen to you in the future if you can honestly face these areas.
3.  Identifying these reactions, writing them down in a list, and **affirming that you want to take control of them will help you to distance yourself from them**. Once your conscious mind has a positive desire to take control, the offending stimulus will hopefully activate this "take-control" reaction, rather than the "flinch" reaction. Key to this is framing the "take control" action as a "positive" outcome enabler will facilitate action, [as Kaj and PJ have already told us](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/21r/pain_and_gain_motivation/).

#### Aanvullende factor: Prioriteiten

Joan Ronner heeft het jaren geleden Al eens gezegd: **jij moet gewoon prioriteiten stellen.**

Ik merk dat ik geen 19 taken op een dag verwerk. Laat staan in een week.

Daarom, als ik dingen gedaan wil krijgen moet ik prioriteiten instellen.
